# Project: SQL CLR - String Compare
====================

## What is it
The intent of this project is to create functions within SQL Serve for comparing how similar two strings are. In order to ensure that these string are as performant as possible, they have been created using SQL CLR in a databse project.

String comparison is a complex topic, and there are several great algorythms available. The ones that this project will focus on are listed below.

- Levenshtein Distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)
- Hamming Distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)
- Jaro-Winkler Distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance)
- Damerau-Levenshtein Distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)
- Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Similarity (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm)

_What use are these string comparison methods?_

As cross system data mining becomse more prevelent, I have found myself working wiht more and more semi-structured and even unstractured data. In order for value to be pulled from these sources it is necessary to be able to recognize patterns and relate this data. Relating data is what relational databases, like SQL Server, do best! These funcitons will hopefully enable database developers and architects specializing in SQL Server to empower their companies to take business intelligence to the next level.
